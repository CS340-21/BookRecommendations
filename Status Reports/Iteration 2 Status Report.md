# Iteration 2 Status Report


## Goals:
1. Set up Google Books API
2. Set up App hosting on AWS
3. Improve frontend skeleton
4. Research AWS gateway and lambda functions as API alternative


## Accomplishments:
1. Google books API project created and API key acquired
2. Ember app hosted on AWS
3. Frontend About information added


We still need to do more research into potentially using AWS gateway or lambda functions to simplify our backend process later down the line, but the crucial set up and research has been done, with frameworks implemented for all of the crucial aspects of our project (front-end, hosting, back-end (API calls). 


## Goals for Next Sprint:
1. Integrate our API with Google Books API
2. Beautify front end (add user interface)
3. Implement book data display (display API data in front end)
